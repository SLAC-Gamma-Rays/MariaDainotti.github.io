My work focuses on application of supervised machine learning techniques for obtaining the redshift of gamma-ray bursts &#40;GRBs&#41; and active-galactic nucleis &#40;AGNs&#41;. We have also investigated classification of GRBs using unsupervised machine learning methods. Furthermore, we also investigated the reconstruction of GRB lightcurves using the technique of Gaussian Process, leading to a significant reduction in errors of GRB properties.

These 3 years were formative and essential in my academic and professional growth. I was able to be featured in two of her research papers, one as an acknowledgment and the other as a co-author. This experience has given me the tools to contribute to every new study I have been a part of while also having the priviledge of being part of an amazing community.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://github.com/SLAC-Gamma-Rays/MariaDainotti.github.io/blob/main/_assets/Testimonial_Leo.pdf">Read Leonardo&#39;s testimonial about his working experience with Maria</a></p> <h2 id=alexander_r_zambrano_tapia ><a href="#alexander_r_zambrano_tapia" class=header-anchor >🟢 Alexander R.

Zambrano Tapia, a 2nd year undergrad at Johns Hopkins University. I began working with Dr. Dainotti in the summer of 2020 with her research on GRB, as I helped in data collection. I was featured in two of her research papers, one as an acknowledgment and the other as a co-author. This experience has shown me more about the scientific research community and motivated me to continue research even through my college life.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://github.com/SLAC-Gamma-Rays/MariaDainotti.github.io/blob/main/_assets/Testimonial_AlexanderZambrano.pdf">Read Alexander&#39;s testimonial about his working experience with Maria</a></p> <h2 id=logan_chan ><a href="#logan_chan" class=header-anchor >🟢 Logan Chan</a></h2> <div class=center ><img src="/MariaDainotti.github.io/assets/0105_Chan_Logan_01.jpg" alt="" /></div> <blockquote> <p>Hi&#33; My name is Logan Cham. I worked with Dr. Maria Dainotti primarily during the summer of 2023 on Part I of the GRB Catalogue. The fact that I was still a high schooler shows Dainotti&#39;s motive to help the younger generation earlier on. She was always kind and patient, while simultaneously keeping me on track with my tasks. It was also easy to ask for help and clarification when needed. Dainotti reinforced the confidence within me to do work well.</p> </blockquote> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Raman Kumar, Biagio De Simone.
