> Hello, my name is Biagio De Simone. I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate from the University of Salerno. I've been working with Maria since March 2020 on the Gamma-Ray Bursts astrophysics and cosmology. Thanks to this collaboration, I published 5 papers as Maria's co-author, in particular I investigated [the Hubble constant tension through Supernovae Ia](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abeb73) and I contributed to build [the most complete catalogue of optical GRBs with redshift to date](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/4/4023/7697178).

> Hi, I am Kamil Kalinowski and I have just completed Master's degree at Aarhus University. I've been working with Maria mostly during my bachelor's degree at Jagiellonian University. I have contributed to the study of [Fundamental Plane Correlations](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac7c64) and to GRB observations from Kiso, with some of the data added to [the GRB catalogue](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/4/4023/7697178?login=false) that was recently published.
