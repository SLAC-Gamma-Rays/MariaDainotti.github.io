# Ph.D. Students

## 🟢 Aditya Narendra
@@center ![](/assets/Aditya.jpg) @@
> Hello, my name is Aditya Narendra. I am fourth year doctoral student at Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland under the supervision of Prof. Agnieszka Pollo and Prof. Dainotti. I have been working with Prof. Dainotti since August 2020 and officially started my doctoral studies from January 2021. My work focuses on application of supervised machine learning techniques for obtaining the redshift of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active-galactic nucleis (AGNs). We have also investigated classification of GRBs using unsupervised machine learning methods. Furthermore, we also investigated the reconstruction of GRB lightcurves using the technique of Gaussian Process, leading to a significant reduction in errors of GRB properties. Currently, we are working on developing a free-to-use webapp that can help the community obtain ML based redshift estimates of GRBs quickly.

> Hello, I am Giada Bargiacchi and I am a 4rd year PhD student at the Scuola Superiore Meridionale in Naples on the project "Cosmology, Space Science & Space Technology". I have been collaborating with Maria since 2021 on the application of Quasars and Gamma-Ray Bursts in cosmology and its implication on the current cosmological tensions. We have published 10 papers together and one review is currently under revision. This collaboration really inspired me and boosted my research.

> Hello, my name is Biagio De Simone. I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate from the University of Salerno. I've been working with Maria since March 2020 on the Gamma-Ray Bursts astrophysics and cosmology. Thanks to this collaboration, I published 5 papers as Maria's co-author, in particular I investigated [the Hubble constant tension through Supernovae Ia](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abeb73) and I contributed to build [the most complete catalogue of optical GRBs with redshift to date](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/4/4023/7697178).

> Hello, I am Aditi Manchanda and I have completed my Master's degree in Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH). My primary interest lies in the intersection of artificial intelligence and astrophysics, specifically in applying ML techniques to analyze astrophysical data. Currently, I am working with Maria on the stochastic reconstruction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves using machine-learning methodologies.

> Hi, my name is Augusto C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira. I'm a PhD in Astrophysics by the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, whose specialty is the theoretical modeling of GRBs and their polarization. I've worked with Maria since 2022 and have a total of 5 accepted/published collaborations in academic journals of high repute, including the recently published [largest optical catalogue of GRBs with measured redshift](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/4/4023/7697178), and three papers in which I was the first author: [1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aca019), [2](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stae2232/7778277), and [3](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4434/12/5/60).

> Hi, My name is Aleksander Lenart. I am currently (10.2024) a final-year Master's degree student at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. I began my collaboration with Maria in April 2020 as a high school student. I had an opportunity to contribute to the research at every stage of creating a paper, from data gathering through developing new statistical procedures to addressing the referee's comments. The long hours of hard work resulted in 10 peer-reviewed papers, 3 conference talks, and 3 posters.
