> Hello, my name is Biagio De Simone. I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate from the University of Salerno. I've been working with Maria since March 2020 on the Gamma-Ray Bursts astrophysics and cosmology. Thanks to this collaboration, I published 5 papers as Maria's co-author, in particular I investigated [the Hubble constant tension through Supernovae Ia](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abeb73) and I contributed to build [the most complete catalogue of optical GRBs with redshift to date](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/4/4023/7697178).

> Hello, I am Giada Bargiacchi and I am a 4rd year PhD student at the Scuola Superiore Meridionale in Naples on the project "Cosmology, Sapce Science & Space Technology". I have been collaborating with Maria since 2021 on the application of Quasars and Gamma-Ray Bursts in cosmology and its implication on the current cosmological tensions. We have published 10 papers together and one review is currently under revision. This collaboration really inspired me and boosted my research.

> Hello, I am Aditi Manchanda and I have completed my Master's degree in Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH). My primary interest lies in the intersection of artificial intelligence and astrophysics, specifically in applying ML techniques to analyze astrophysical data. Currently, I am working with Maria on the stochastic reconstruction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves using machine-learning methodologies.

> Hi, I am Kamil Kalinowski and I have just completed Master's degree at Aarhus University. I've been working with Maria mostly during my bachelor's degree at Jagiellonian University. I have contributed to the study of [Fundamental Plane Correlations](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac7c64) and to GRB observations from Kiso, with some of the data added to [the GRB catalogue](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/4/4023/7697178?login=false) that was recently published.

> Hi, my name is Augusto C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira. I'm a PhD in Astrophysics by the Universidad Nacional Aut칩noma de M칠xico, whose specialty is the theoretical modeling of GRBs and their polarization. I've worked with Maria since 2022 and have a total of 5 accepted/published collaborations in academic journals of high repute, including the recently published [largest optical catalogue of GRBs with measured redshift](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/4/4023/7697178), and a [couple](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aca019) of [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12904) in which I was the first author.

> Hi, My name is Aleksander Lenart. I am currently (10.2024) a final-year Master's degree student at Jagiellonian University in Krak칩w. I began my collaboration with Maria in April 2020 as a high school student. I had an opportunity to contribute to the research at every stage of creating a paper, from data gathering through developing new statistical procedures to addressing the referee's comments. The long hours of hard work resulted in 10 peer-reviewed papers, 3 conference talks, and 3 posters.
