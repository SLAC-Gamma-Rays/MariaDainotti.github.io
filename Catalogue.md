# An optical Gamma-ray Burst catalogue with measured redshift

## ðŸŸ¢ Data release of 535 Gamma-ray Bursts and colour evolution
@@center ![](/assets/grbLC.png) @@
We are happy to announce the publication of the most complete data collection of Gamma-ray Bursts observed in the optical wavelengths with a measured value of the redshift. Thanks to a worldwide network of professors, researchers, collaborators, observatories, and students, 535 light curves are available for the scientific community to use. A user-friendly web app based on Streamlit has been built to allow a rapid and comfortable light curve inspection, colour evolution analysis, and download. The whole package of Python functions useful to the optical catalogue is called grbLC.
